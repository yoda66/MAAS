## Going Parallel

Because we have deployed multiple docker containers on our backend infrastructure,
we have the processing capability of executing pipeline jobs in parallel.
If the Gitlab configuration has different jobs listed in the same stage without any dependencies,
it will leverage concurrency to execute those jobs.

We have two different places in our architecture to take advantage of concurrency.
First of all there is a concurrency setting in each gitlab runner **toml** configuration file.
